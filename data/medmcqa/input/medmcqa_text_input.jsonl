B: Normal HbF and normal HbA2Alpha (0) thalassemia -Individuals with this disorder are not able to produce any functional alpha-globin and thus are unable to make any functional hemoglobin A, F, or A2. This leads to the development of hydrops fetalis, also known as hemoglobin Ba, a condition that is incompatible with extra uterine life.Alpha (+) thalassemia - genetic mutations that result in decreased production of alpha-globin usually due to the functional deletion of 1 of the 4 alpha globin genes. Based on the number of inherited alpha genes, it is subclassified into 3 general forms:Thalassemia (-u/ a a) is characterized by inheritance of 3 normal a-genes. These patients are referred to clinically as silent carrier of alpha thalassemia. Other names for this condition are alpha thalassemia minima, alpha thalassemia-2 trait, and heterozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia minor. The affected individuals exhibit no abnormality clinically and may be hematologically normal or have mild reductions in red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of 2 normal alpha genes due to either heterozygosity for alpha (0) thalassemia (u a/ --) or homozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia (-u/-a) results in the development of alpha thalassemia minor or alpha thalassemia-1 trait. The affected individuals are clinically normal but frequently have minimal anemia and reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of one normal alpha gene (-a/ --) results in abundant formation of hemoglobin H.

What could be the probable diagnosis –\nAnswer Choices: (A) VSD large (B) Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (C) Ebstein anomaly (D) AP window defect", "label": ["B"], "label_rationale": "livpolastic left heart syndrome \n\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when parts of the left side of the heart (mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta) do not develop completely. The condition is present at birth (congenital).\nHypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10 % of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.\nThe problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:\n\n(i) Aorta-the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body\nEntrace and exit of the ventricle\nMitral and aortic valves\n\nThis causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.\nIn patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for awhile, but this extra workoad eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.\nThe only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and left side of the heart, or between the systemic\n\narteries and pumonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blodd to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two\nof these connections:\n(i) Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium)\nDuctus arteriosus (a small vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)\n\nBoth of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.\nIn babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. if the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body.\nBabies with known hypoplatic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosusopen.\nBecause there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood reaming to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).\n\nSymptoms\n\nAt first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may apper normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:\n\n\nBluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color\nCold hands and feed (extremities)\n\n\nLethargy\n\n\nPoor pulse\nPoor suckling and feeding\nPounding heart\nRapid breathing\nShortness of breath.\nSince the systemic circulation is dependent on the patent ductus arteriosus the closure of ductus arterious leads to shock.\nSigns of heart failure usually appears within the first few days or weeks of life and include dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and low cardiac output. When PDA closes suddenly shock occurs all the peripheral pulses may be weak or absent.\n\nVentricular septal defect\n\nThese patients with VSD's become symptomatic around 6-10 weeks of age.\nThey usually present with congestive cardiac failure.\n\nEbstein's anomaly \n\nEbstein's anomaly consists of downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid value into the right ventricle.\nThese patients usually present in teenage/adolescent years.\nThey may also present in infancy but they usually do not present with shock or severe hypoperfusion.\n\nAorticopulmonary window defect\n\nAn Aorticopulmanry window defect consists of a communication between the ascending Aorta and the main pulmonary artery.\nIn these cases minimal cyanosis is present and they may present with heart failure in infancy.", "subject_name": "Pediatrics", "topic_name": null}

D/D Atrial fibrillation Multifocal atrial tachycardia P wave absent P wave present Variable RR interval Therefore ruled out P wave varying amplitual and answer is MAT. Trick to solve: First check if patient has tachycardia/bradycardia RR interval Narrow QRS suggests supraventricular tachycardia COPD is the reason for multifocal atrial tachycardia due to right ventricular strain causing RV enlargement causing right axis duration.

The 2 most common symptoms are usually fever and flank pain. E. coli is the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis due to its unique ability to adhere to and colonize the urinary tract and kidneys.Histopathology will usually reveal necrosis or putrid abscess formation within the renal parenchyma. The renal tissues are infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages and plasma cells. However, architecture is not completely disorganized.The presence of white blood cells within or upon casts strongly suggests pyelonephritis, direct infection of the kidney.

Now here let’s take a look at its management.\\\nManagement of DIC\n\nThe most important step is to terminate the pregnancy- vaginal delivery without episiotomy is preferred to cesarean section\nVolume replacement by crystalloids or colloids will reduce the amount of whole blood needed to restore the blood volume.\n500 ml of fresh blood raises the fibrinogen level approximately by 12.5 mg/100 ml and platelets by 10,000–15,000 cu mm. Fresh blood- helps in flushing out fibrin degradation product and improving the micro circulation.\nTo replace fibrinogen- Fresh frozen plasma should be given: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is extracted from whole blood. It contains fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, clotting factors V, XI, XII. FFP transfusion provides both volume replacement and coagulation factors. One unit of FFP (250 mL) raises the fibrinogen by 5-10 mg/dL. FFP does not need to be ABO or Rh compatible.\nCryoprecipitate is obtained from thawed FFP. It is rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, Von Willebrand’s factor, and XIII. Cryoprecipitate provides less volume (40 mL) compared to FFP (250 mL). So it should not be used for volume replacement. One unit of cryoprecipitate increases the fibrinogen level by 5-10 mg/dL.\nIn case of active bleeding with platelet counts < 50,000/ml or prophylactically with platelet count 20–30,000/ml – platelet replacement should be done. Platelet should ABO and Rh specific. 1 units (50 ml) raises the platelet count by 7500/ ml\nRecombinant activated factors VIIA: (60-100 μg/kg IV) can reverse DIC within 10 minute as it is a precusor for extrinsic clotting cascade which is replaced.\nRole of Heparin\n\nAccording to Williams Obs. “Heparin is not used in DIC.”\nAccording to COGDT 10/e, p 999\n“Heparin acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin III but has little effect on activated coagulation factors. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with fulminant DIC and central nervous system insults, fulminant liver failure, or obstetric accidents. The one instance, however, in which heparin has been demonstrated to benefit pregnancy-related DIC is in the case of the retained dead fetus with intact vascular system, where heparin may be administered to interrupt the coagulation process and thrombocytopenia for several days until delivery may be implemented.”\nAs far as EACA is concerned- Williams Obs. 22/e, p 844 says –\n“EACA is not recommended in case of DIC.”\nAccording to Williams Obs 23/e, p 787\n“It use in most types of obstetric coagulopathy has not been efficacious & not recommended”", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "topic_name": null}

Mechanism of action- After entering the cell by diffusion, its nitro group is reduced by ceain redox proteins operative only in anaerobic microbes to a highly reactive nitro radical which exes cytotoxicity. The nitro radical of metronidazole acts as an electron sink which competes with the biological electron acceptors of the anaerobic organism for the electrons generated by the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme pathway of pyruvate oxidation. The energy metabolism of anaerobes that have no mitochondria is thus, disrupted. Aerobic environment attenuates cytotoxicity of metronidazole by inhibiting its reductive activation. Moreover, O2 competes with the nitro radical of metronidazole for the free electrons generated during energy metabolism of anaerobes. Metronidazole, in addition, has been found to inhibit cell mediated immunity, to induce mutagenesis and to cause radiosensitization.

C: Nitrous oxideGeneral anaesthesia can be induced by intravenous (IV) injection, or breathing a volatile anaesthetic through a facemask (inhalational induction).Onset of anaesthesia is faster with IV injection than with inhalation, taking about 10-20 seconds to induce total unconsciousness.This has the advantage of avoiding the excitatory phase of anaesthesia, and thus reduces complications related to induction of anaesthesia.An inhalational induction may be chosen by the anesthesiologist where IV access is difficult to obtain, where difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or due to patient preference (e.g. children).Commonly used IV induction agents include propofol, sodium thiopental, etomidate, and ketamine.The most commonly-used agent for inhalational induction is sevoflurane because it causes less irritation than other inhaled gasesIn order to prolong anaesthesia for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained.

However, even low-dose pills pose significant risk in women > 35 years of age, diabetics, hypertensives and in those who smoke. The excess risk is due to the estrogen component of the OC, and normalizes shortly after stopping the OC.\nRise in BP: Occurred in 5-10% women taking the earlier pills. The again is less frequent and smaller in magnitude with the low-dose pills of today. If the BP rises, best is to stop OCs: the BP normalizes in the next 3-6 months. Both the estrogen and progestin components are responsible for this effect, probably by increasing plasma angiotensinogen level and renin activity which have been found to be raised during OC use. Aldosterone secretion is enhanced resulting in salt and water retention.\n\nReference: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology Eighth Edition KD TRIPATHI page no 351", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "topic_name": null}

These divide and acquire haemoglobin, which turns the cytoplasm pink; the nucleus condenses and is extruded from the cell. The ﬁrst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (‘polychromasia’). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.\nProliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S   and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no  915", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": null}

D: VancomycinVancomycins bind to the peptides of the peptidoglycan monomers and block both the formation of gycosidic bonds between the sugars by the transgycosidase enzymes and the formation of the peptide cross-links by the transpeptidase enzymes. This results in a weak cell wall and osmotic lysis of the bacterium.The fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, etc.) work by inhibiting one or more of a group of enzymes called topoisomerase, enzymes needed for supercoiling, replication and separation of circular bacterial DNA.For example, DNA gyrase is a topoisomerase that catalyzes the negative supercoiling of the circular DNA found in bacteria. Topoisomerase IV, on the other hand, is involved in the relaxation of the supercoiled circular DNA, enabling the separation of the interlinked daughter chromosomes at the end of bacterial DNA replication.In gram-positive bacteria, the main target for fluoroquinolones is DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), an enzyme responsible for supercoiling of bacterial DNA during DNA replication; in gram-negative bacteria, the primary target is topoisomerase IV, an enzyme responsible for relaxation of supercoiled circular DNA and separation of the inter-linked daughter chromosomes.The tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, demeclocycline, minocycline, etc.) block bacterial translation by binding reversibly to the 30S subunit and distoing it in such a way that the anticodons of the charged tRNAs cannot align properly with the codons of the mRNA.The aminoglycosides (streptomycin, neomycin, netilmicin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin, etc.) bind irreversibly to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes.", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "topic_name": null}

Those with degenerative myopia have an increased incidence of cataract formation (nuclear cataracts are most typical).Some of the most typical features of degenerative myopia are:Vitreous liquefaction and posterior vitreous detachmentPeripapillary atrophy appearing as temporal choroidal or scleral crescents or rings around the optic discLattice degeneration in the peripheral retinaTilting or malinseion of the optic disc, usually associated with myopic conusThinning of the retinal pigment epithelium with resulting atrophic appearance of the fundusEctasia of the sclera posteriorly (posterior staphyloma)Breaks in Bruch's membrane and choriocapillaris, resulting in lines across the fundus called \"lacquer cracks\"Fuchs spot in the macular area.", "subject_name": "Ophthalmology", "topic_name": null}

It is believed that carbon can embrittle the alloys, even though the investment is heated to temperatures that burn out the carbon. Some evidence indicates that palladium reacts with carbon at temperatures above 1504 °C. Thus, if the casting temperature of an alloy with high palladium content exceeds this critical point, a phosphate investment without carbon should be used.\nRef: Phillip’s 12th edition page 208", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}

This is the reason for increase in serum alpha fetoprotein in neural tube defects and ventral wall defects.\nMaternal screening is done between 15-20 weeks (according to Williams 23/e, p 289, Fernando Arias 3/e, p 58).\nIt is measured in nanograms per ml and reported as a multiple of the median (MOM).\nMSAFP of 2.5 MOM is considered as the upper limit of normal (for twin pregnancy it is 3.5 MOM).\n\nNow after having this basic knowledge lets have a look at the question.\nIn the question alpha fetoprotein will be increased in the following conditions.\n\nGastroschisis – Ventral wall defect\nOmphalocele – Ventral wall defect\nSpina bifida occulta – Neural tube defect\n\nIn Down’s syndrome - AFP levels are decreased.\nSpina bifida occulta:\nSpina bifida occulta is usually a small, clinically asymptomatic defect, covered by skin, so there are less chances of mixing of fetal serum and maternal serum. Therefore the maternal serum alphafetoprotein level usually does not increase in spina bifida occulta.\n“In the fetus with a defect such as anencephaly or spina bifida, AFP enters the amniotic fluid in increased amounts, leading to higher levels in the maternal serum as well. Levels of AFP are elevated in amniotic fluid and maternal serum only when such lesions are “open,” i.e., when the neural tissue is exposed or covered by only a thin membrane. When NTDs are skin-covered, AFP does not escape from the fetal circulation, and such defects are generally not detected by maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) screening”.\nUSG in Obs. and Gyane by Callen 4/e, p 25\nOmphalocele: \nFernando Arias 3/e, p 84\nIt is a midline defect of the anterior abdominal wall characterized by herniation of the abdominal viscera into the base of the umbilical cord.\nThe protruding organs are typically covered by a thin aminoperitoneal membrane. Omphalocele has a strong association with high levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein because the ventral wall defect allows mixing of fetal and maternal circulation.\nGastroschisis:\nFernando Arias 2/e, p 83\nGastroschisis is a paraumbilical defect of the anterior abdominal wall, through which abdominal viscera herniates. The defect is usually located on the right side of the cord insertion and compromises the full thickness of the abdominal wall. There is no sac or membrane covering the herniated organs. This defect is associated with high alpha feto protein titre.\nBoth gastroschisis and omphalocele are ventral wall defects containing abdominal organs and both are associated with high alphafetoprotein level in maternal serum.\nBut it is likely that alphafetoprotein level will be higher in patients with gastroschisis as there is no sac or membrane which covers the herniated organs in this defect. So there is more possibility of fetoprotein leak into the maternal serum or amniotic fluid in Gastroschisis. The answer is further supported by the following graph from\nUSG in Obs. and Gynae by Callen 4/e, p 28", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "topic_name": null}

There is no hearing loss or other neurologic symptoms. Positional testing establishes the diagnosis and helps to differentiate it from positional veigo of central origin. Disease caused by a disorder of posterior semicircular canal though many patients have history of head trauma and ear infection. It has been demonstrated that otoconial debris, consisting of crystals and calcium carbonate, is released from the degeneration macula of the utricle and floats freely in the endolymph. When it settles on the cupula of posterior semicircular canal in a critical head position, it causes displacement of the cupula and veigo. The veigo is fatigable on assuming the same position repeatedly due to dispersal of the otoconia but can be induced again after a period of rest. Thus, typical history and Hallpike maneuver establishes the diagnosis. The condition can be treated by performing Epley's maneuver. The principle of this maneuver is to reposition the otoconial debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle. The doctor stands behind the patient and the assistant on the side. The patient is made to sit on the table so that when he is made to lie down, his head is beyond the edge of the table as is done in Dix-Hallpike maneuver. His face is turned 450 to the affected side. The maneuver consists of five positions * Position 1. With the head turned 450, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix-Hallpike). It will cause veigo and nystagmus. Wait till veigo and nystagmus subside. * Position 2. Head is now turned so that affected ear is facing up at a 900 rotation. * Position 3. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a lateral recumbent position in a 900 -rotation face-down position. * Position 4. Patient is now brought to a sitting position with head still turned to the unaffected side by 450. * Position 5. The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 200. There should be a pause at each position till there is no nystagmus or there is slowing of nystagmus, before changing to the next position. After maneuver is complete, patient should maintain an upright posture for 48 h. Eighty percent of the patients will be cured by a single maneuver. If the patients remain symptomatic, the maneuver can be repeated. A bone vibrator placed on the mastoid bone helps to loosen the debris. - Meniere's disease: Has an episodic veigo and it lasts for >20 minutes. - Vestibular neuronitis: Veigo lasts for many days. - Labyrinthitis: There is a history of fever and trauma, and the veigo lasts for days.", "subject_name": "ENT", "topic_name": "AIIMS 2018"}

Psoas abscesses may arise from a hematogenous source, by contiguous spread from an intra- abdominal or pelvic process, or by contiguous spread from nearby bony structures (e.g., veebral bodies). Associated osteomyelitis due to spread from bone to muscle or from muscle to bone is common in psoas abscesses. When pott's disease was common, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was a frequent cause of psoas abscess. Currently, either S. aureus or a mixture of enteric organisms including aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli is usually isolated from psoas abscesses in the United States. S. aureus is most likely to be isolated when a psoas abscess arises from hematogenous spread or a contiguous focus of osteomyelitis; a mixed enteric flora is the most likely etiology when the abscess has an intra- abdominal or pelvic source. Patients with psoas abscesses frequently present with fever, lower abdominal or back pain, or pain referred to the hip or knee. CT is the most useful diagnostic technique.\"- Harrison 19/e p852 \"Spinal TB (Pott's disease or tuberculous spondylitis) often involves two or more adjacent veebral bodies. Whereas the upper thoracic spine is the most common site of spinal TB in children, the lower thoracic and upper lumbar veebrae are usually affected in adults. From the anterior superior or inferior angle of the veebral body, the lesion slowly reaches the adjacent body, later affecting the interveebral disk. With advanced disease, collapse of veebral bodies results in kyphosis (gibbus). A paraveebral \"cold\" abscess may also form. In the upper spine, this abscess may track to and penetrate the chest wall, presenting as a soft tissue mass; in the lower spine, it may reach the inguinal ligaments or present as a psoas abscess. \"Harrison 19/e p1110", "subject_name": "Surgery", "topic_name": "AIIMS 2017"}

M. Ricketts suggested using an esthetic (E) plane to evaluate the relationship between the nose, lips and chin. Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. A quick method to look at one profile is to imagine a line tangent from the lower chin to the nose tip. Cephalometrically, Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. Normal values suggest that the upper lip is 4 mm behind the E line, while the lower lip lies 2 mm behind this reference line. It is important to mention that, this reference line is influenced a great deal by the growth of the nose and also varies with age and sex. Ricketts recommended that lip position should be analyzed using the nose–chin line as a reference point.

He realized the potential of releasing the brake and thereby unleashing our immune cells to attack tumors.Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoints are negative regulators of T-cell immune function. Inhibition of these targets, resulting in increased activation of the immune system, has led to new immunotherapies for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers.For several types of cancer, including lung cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma and melanoma checkpoint therapy against PD-1 has proven more effective and positive results found.But recent clinical studies indicate that for melanoma the combination therapy of both CTLA-4 and PD-1 is more effective.Thus, Allison and Honjo combine different strategies to release the brakes on the immune system with the aim of eliminating tumor cells even more efficiently.Their paper formed the basis of current cancer immunotherapy.But the original concept of cancer immunotherapy was discovered by William Bradley Coley (1872).", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": null}

Symptoms may be mild for many patients, but if left untreated, it can lead to delirium tremens, an uncommon but severe and life-threatening manifestation of withdrawal marked by severe hallucinations, disorientation, and autonomic overactivity. Symptoms and signs include the following: Profoundly delirious state associated with tremulousness and agitation. Excessive motor activity (most notable as a tremor that affects the face, tongue, and extremities but that may also involve speech) and purposeless activity such as picking at the bedclothes. Hallucinations, classically visual rather than auditory, are a prominent feature. Autonomic nervous system hyperactivity: tachycardia, dilated pupils, fever, and hyperhidrosis. Loss of orientation as to time and place. Such patients are often oblivious to the most obvious features of the surrounding environment. Treatment Note temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and record results twice hourly to monitor for hyperpyrexia and hypotension.

The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:\n\nAmount of force: Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.\nDirection of force: According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\n\tIn most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.\n\tHowever, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.\nDuration of force: A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.\nFrequency of use: 12-14 hrs/day.\n\nKey Concept:\nAccording to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\nReference: Textbook of orthodontics 2nd ed Gurkeerat Singh page no 502", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}
